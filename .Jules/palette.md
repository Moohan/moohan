## 2024-05-24 - Alt Text for Profile READMEs

**Learning:** Descriptive alt text is crucial for accessibility, especially in GitHub profile READMEs, which often feature badges and stats as images. Generic alt text like "ORCID" or "Top Langs" is insufficient for users relying on screen readers.

**Action:** When working on profile READMEs, I will audit all images and ensure their alt text is descriptive and provides context. For badges, the alt text should include the information displayed on the badge itself (e.g., "ORCID ID: 0000-0002-5380-2029"). For charts or stats, it should summarize the information being presented (e.g., "James's most used languages").
