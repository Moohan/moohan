## 2024-07-25 - Semantic Heading Structure in Markdown

**Learning:** The accessibility of a document, especially for screen reader users, is significantly impacted by a logical and consistent heading structure. Skipping heading levels (e.g., using an `<h3>` directly after an `<h1>`) disrupts the document's outline and can make it difficult to navigate.

**Action:** When editing Markdown or HTML, I will always review the heading hierarchy to ensure it is sequential and semantically correct. This small check can make a big difference for accessibility.
