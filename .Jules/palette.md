**Learning:** A logical, sequential heading structure (e.g., h1 -> h2 -> h3) in Markdown and HTML is critical for screen reader accessibility. Starting a document with a single H1 heading provides a clear entry point and allows users of assistive technology to easily understand the document's structure and navigate it effectively.
