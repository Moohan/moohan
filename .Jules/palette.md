## 2024-07-25 - Semantic Heading Structure
**Learning:** A logical, sequential heading structure (e.g., h1 -> h2 -> h3) in Markdown and HTML is critical for screen reader accessibility. Starting a document with a single H1 heading provides a clear entry point and allows users of assistive technology to easily understand the document's structure and navigate it effectively.
**Action:** In future reviews of Markdown files or HTML content, I will always check that the document begins with a single H1 and that the heading hierarchy is followed correctly, without skipping levels.

## 2024-07-26 - Accessible Deprecation Notices
**Learning:** Visual cues like strikethrough are not sufficient to indicate a deprecated link to users of assistive technologies. Screen readers may not announce this formatting, leading to confusion.
**Action:** When marking a link as deprecated or archived, I will add explicit, visible text (e.g., "(deprecated)") adjacent to the link to ensure its status is clear to all users.
