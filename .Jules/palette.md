## 2024-07-22 - Semantic Heading Structure

**Learning:** A logical and sequential heading structure (e.g., `h1` -> `h2` -> `h3`) is not just for visual hierarchy, but is critical for screen reader users to navigate and understand the content of a page. Skipping heading levels can be confusing and disrupt the user's mental model of the document.

**Action:** When working with Markdown or HTML, always ensure the heading levels are sequential and logically structured. Do not skip levels for stylistic reasons.
