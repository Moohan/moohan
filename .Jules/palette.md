## 2024-07-25 - Semantic Heading Structure
**Learning:** A logical, sequential heading structure (e.g., h1 -> h2 -> h3) in Markdown and HTML is critical for screen reader accessibility. Starting a document with a single H1 heading provides a clear entry point and allows users of assistive technology to easily understand the document's structure and navigate it effectively.
**Action:** In future reviews of Markdown files or HTML content, I will always check that the document begins with a single H1 and that the heading hierarchy is followed correctly, without skipping levels.

## 2026-02-01 - Linked Image Tooltips
**Learning:** For images wrapped in links, the title attribute should be placed on the <a> tag rather than the <img> tag. This ensures that the tooltip describes the link's destination (the action) rather than just the image's content, providing better context for users.
**Action:** When adding links to images, I will place descriptive title attributes on the anchor tag and ensure the image's alt text remains descriptive of the image itself.
