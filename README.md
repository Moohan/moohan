### Hi there 👋

I'm a Principal Information Analyst for [Public Health Scotland](https://www.publichealthscotland.scot/) with a passion for data and its power to drive meaningful insights. My journey into the world of data started with a Maths BSc from the [University of St Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/), and since then, I've been on an exciting ride through the ever-evolving landscape of data science.

I live in the beautiful region of Perthshire, Scotland, and I'm a big advocate for remote work. It gives me the flexibility to not only excel in my professional life but also serve my community as a retained firefighter.

When I'm not wrangling data or responding to emergencies, I enjoy exploring my hobbyist interest in Java for Android app development.

## Skills

Here are some of the technologies I work with:

I'm particularly proficient in R's `tidyverse` ecosystem for data manipulation and visualization.
