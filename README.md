# Hi there 👋

I'm James Hayes (née McMahon) (he/him), a Principal Information Analyst for [Public Health Scotland](https://www.publichealthscotland.scot/ "Visit the Public Health Scotland website") with a passion for data and its power to drive meaningful insights. My journey into the world of data started with a Maths BSc from the [University of St Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/ "Visit the University of St Andrews website"), and since then, I've been on an exciting ride through the ever-evolving landscape of data science.

I live in the beautiful region of [Perthshire, Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perthshire "Learn more about Perthshire on Wikipedia"), and I'm a big advocate for remote work. Working for PHS in this way is excellent for maintaining a healthy work-life balance and ensuring I can maximize my time with my family. It also gives me the flexibility to serve my community as a retained firefighter.

When I'm not wrangling data or responding to emergencies, I enjoy exploring my hobbyist interest in Python.

## Skills

Here are some of the technologies I work with:

I'm particularly proficient in R's `tidyverse` ecosystem for data manipulation and visualization, and I have extensive experience in mentoring and training others in these skills.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I'm proud to have worked on:

### Major Projects

*   **[Source Linkage Files](https://github.com/Public-Health-Scotland/source-linkage-files "View the Source Linkage Files project on GitHub"):** I played a key role in the management and development of source linkage files, which are crucial for connecting different health datasets and enabling powerful, large-scale research.
*   **[Locality Profiles](https://github.com/Public-Health-Scotland/list-localities-profiles "View the Locality Profiles project on GitHub"):** I led the creation of locality profiles, providing detailed health and social care data at a local level to help inform decision-making and improve services.

### R Packages
